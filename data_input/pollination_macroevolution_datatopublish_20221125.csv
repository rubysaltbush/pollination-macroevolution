The flowers first open in the late afternoon, at which time the already receptive stigma exceeds the anthers by a few millimeters so that in completely undisturbed flowers there is no pollina- tion and no seeds are formed. The anthers are sufficiently close to the stigma, however, so that even a slight jarring of a flower at anthesis re- sults in some self-pollination. These observations on plants growing in the greenhouse indicate that in natural populations outcrossing would be encouraged by large insect visitors that would first touch the extended stigma as they approached the flower. The same pollinator would cause selfing by bending the stigma back into the anthers, as well as by visiting different flowers of the same plant. Thus, in natural populations the in- breeding-outbreeding balance must lie well toward the inbreeding ex- treme. Although we have not observed pollination of E. bartonioides in natural populations, we can make a reasonable prediction about its polli- nator, since a model is available in the flowers of Mentzelia laevicaulis (sect. Bartonia) which are very similar in general conformation, size, color, and opening time.

As in Orchidaceae, the evolutionary trend towards specialized pollination has implied abundant speciation and often accounts for high rates of endemism in different regions. Due to the strong expression of protandry, most Impatiens are functionally monoecious. During the male phase, whenthe flower just opens, the stamens are fused by their anther walls to form a ""brush"" which completely covers the pistil. The upper filaments are longer than the lower ones, and the anthers project downwards and can ""brush"" the pollinator's back or head and transmit the pollen upon the next pollinator visiting the flower. During this stage, the stigmas are non- receptive and not exposed to come into contact with the pollinator. At the end of the male phase, the stamens are shed as a single unit and the stigmas become receptive. Extra-floral nectaries, usually in the form of stipitate glands, are often present and may reward ""safety guards"" (usually ants) protecting the flowers from damage by non-pollinating animals. The pollination biology and breeding systems of the majority of species have not yet been studied, and most available studies have been conducted with the temperate species I. capensis and I. pallida. Published reports and personal field observations suggest the following animals as possible pollinators: honeybees (e.g. I. austrotanzanica, I. gomphophylla), bumblebees, solitary bees, butterflies (e.g. I. walleriana, I. hoehneliana), moths, hawkmoths (e.g. I. teitensis), flys (e.g. I. elatostemoides), and sunbirds (e.g. I. niamniamensis, I. keilii, I. paucidentata) (Arisumi 1974, 1980; Beck et al. 1974; Rust 1977, 1979; Kato 1988; Randall and Hilu 1990; Wilson 1995; Hurlbert et al. 1996).""",guessed from the illustration,syndrome,"3 - Pollination syndrome but adaptations for animal pollination (nectar, scent, staminodes, sticky pollen) or else wind pollination (very reduced perianth, feathery stigma, exposed anthers with dry powdery pollen) or abiotic pollination clearly described",nectar,yes,,"""Usually, each flower has only two reduced lateral sepals and one petal-like lower sepal, which is modified into a nectary-tipped spur""",interpreted from the text,,species,Ruby Stephens,31/3/2022

Apis mellifera L. was also attracted in large numbers, but cannot vibrate the flowers for pollen. A small beetle,Cantharis nigriceps Le Conte, was also common on the flowers...To test for wind pollination, inflorescences were bagged with organdy bags or with fiberglass screen bags...Wind also has a role in the pollination of Clethra. Results of the bagging study (see Table 11) indicate that a fruit set of 16-24% could be due to wind alone (fiberglass treatment). Clethra pollen is small and smooth which would aid pollination by wind. Fruit set in the Pollen-tector bags may have been facilitated by wind shaking the bags as well, releasing pollen from the porate anthers. Insect damage to buds, ovaries or maturing fruits, and predation by birds may have af­fected the fruit set on the control inflorescences.

Vander Kloet (1977) reported evidence against autogamy in diploid and in tetraploid V. uliginosum: no selfed fruit and no pollen grain germination was observed following self-pollination. Nevertheless, Warming (1908) estimated that the flowers are distinctly adapted for cross-pollination and he observed bee pollinators in Sweden (Table 1). Lundberg (1974) also observed pollination by bees in Sweden (Table 1): V. uliginosum was the most frequently visited plant by the alpine Bombus species collecting nectar and pollen (B. alpinus, B. arcticus and B. hyperboreus) but eight other species of Bombus were observed (Table 1). In Finland, Teras (1985) also observed seven Bombus species (Table 1). In Germany, Knuth (Poll. 2, Table 1) noted many species of true and cuckoo bumble bees (Bombus and Psithyrus), five species of Andrena, five species of Halictus (or Lasioglossum), four species of Nomada, as well as Formica fusca, Colletes cunicularius, Osmia rufa and Apis mellifera. Moreover, the butterflies (Rhopalocera) Celastrina (= Lycaena) argiolus and Callophrys (= Thecla) rubi and the Diptera Lucilia caesar, Empis opaca, Tachina fera, the syrphids Eristalis arbustorum, E. horticola, E. intricarius, Sericomyia lappona, and Rhingia rostrata were observed (Knuth Poll. 2).
In Upper Belgium, the following insects have been observed pollinating flowers (Jacquemart 1993a;b). The major pollinators are bumble bee queens: Pyro- bombus (= Bombus) pratorum L. (32% of the percentage abundance of pollinators captured in 1989), Bombus lucorum L. (18%), Bombus cryptarum Fabr. (4%), Megabombus (= Bombus) pascuorum floralis Gmelin (2%), Psithyrus bohemicus Seidl. (2%) and Pyrobombus (= Bombus) jonellus Kirby (2%). Some Apis mellifera L. (6%) and Vespa spp. (2%) were observed. Other important insects were Syrphidae: Eristalis pertinax Scopoli (10%), E. rupium Fabr. (10%), E. horticola Degeer (8%), E. tenax L. (4%, in 1990), Rhingia campestris Meigen (2%) and Seri- comyia lappona L. (4% in 1990)....The results of observations and experiments (Jacquemart & Thompson 1996) have made it clear that
flowers of V. uliginosum are both self- and cross-pollinated. The fruits produced by crossing were heavier than those from selfing and contained more seeds, but there was no difference in fruit set (Jacquemart & Thompson 1996)...The general conclusion is that, owing to its clonal growth, the restricted and selective activities of pollinators and the facility with which self-pollination by wind and gravity, or facilitated by insects, takes place, the plant must be classified as an habitual in-breeder, particularly in the northern areas (Shevtsova et al. 1995) even if cross-pollination, effected mainly by bumblebees, promotes a high seed set.""",explicit from the text (described as such),system,"5 - Pollination system but wind pollination not explicitly tested for, pollination rewards clear, pollination efficiency of different pollinators not explicitly tested but pollinators observed transporting pollen and effecting pollination",nectar and pollen,yes,yes,"""Flowers have a pleasant, sweet, aromatic perfume which is somewhat reminiscent of Asperula odorata (Warming 1908)…V. uliginosum was the most frequently visited plant by the alpine Bombus species collecting nectar and pollen""",explicit from the text (described as such),wind may effect some very slight self-pollination but overall syndrome and most of TRY entries are for straight up insect pollination,species,Ruby Stephens,28/1/2022

Many narrow ray florets are present, of vermilion or deep orange colour, including a three tipped ligule with one small lobe opposite. The florets are hermaphroditic and have a small nectary. The numerous disc florets are hermaphroditic, actinomorphic and five-toothed, and bear a large nectary that fills the corolla-tube with liquid to a depth of 1–1.5 mm. The stiff polliniferous styles emerge 1 cm beyond the limb. It was observed as a cultivar in a Buenos Aires park, October (det. Cuatrecasas).

Pollen grains are dispersed in monads. Comprehensive field studies in Audouinia capitata (Wright et al. 1991) revealed that small pollen-feeding beetles (Nitidulidae) appear to be the most common pollen vectors. Pollen dispersal by these beetles is limited to short distances (less than 4 m) which leads to limited gene flow within and between A. capitata populations.

Ants were commonly observed on female flower heads, presumably collecting stigmatic fluid, however they were rarely spotted on male rachillae at anthe- sis. Among the beetle visitors, Epuraea sp. was clearly the most abundant one, mainly observed on male inflorescences during anthesis. This confirms that this morphotype is feed- ing on the copious amounts of pollen produced by the young male inflorescences (Roulston and Cane 2000). Although they carried relatively small amounts of pollen, individuals of Epuraea sp. were omnipresent. Those measured for pol- len loads were sampled from the female flower heads, which confírms their capability to transfer at least a small amount of pollen grains from male to female flowers. Pollen grains were mainly observed on the dorsal side of the Epuraea sp. bee- tles. Cillaeinid sp. were less frequently observed, but carried more pollen grains than the smaller Epuraea sp. Their feed- ing behavior was almost identical to that of Epuraea sp. We consider the more frequent species of nitidulid beetles capa- ble of assuring successful pollination. They show a remark- able resemblance to Epuraea sp. found by Mantequilla et al. (2016) in the nipa stands near Davao City, Philippines as shown in Fig. 4. Hoppe (2004) listed nitidulid beetles among the most frequent visitors to female flowers in the receptive phase. Both Hoppe (2004) and Mantequilla et al. (2016) reported pollen loads of nitidulid beetles to be low, however Hoppe (2004) noticed a rise in pollen load after onset of male anthesis...In contrast to several previous studies (Essig 1973, Fong 1987, Hoppe 2004, Mantequilla et al. 2016) we did not observe drosophilid visitors to the inflorescences in this study. Since Drosophila flies are almost omnipresent and highly generalist this is a surprise. We can only explain this by edge effects or perhaps the use of pesticides in the adjacent botanical garden...The role of wind as a contributor to pollination was unlikely according to Hoppe (2004). An adhesive tape test suggested that very few pollen grains were transferred to female inflorescences by wind. Essig (1973) also dismisses wind as a significant contributor to pollination due to the large, globular and sticky pollen grains.""",interpreted from the text,system,"5 - Pollination system but wind pollination not explicitly tested for, pollination rewards clear, pollination efficiency of different pollinators not explicitly tested but pollinators observed transporting pollen and effecting pollination",,,,"""The male inflorescences of nipa emitted a characteristic coumarin smell at anthesis, which was also reported by Hoppe (2004).

In Flagellaria the flowers are somewhat scented and the inner perianth (the perianth consists of the petals and sepals) is white and showy (Backer 1954) in contrast to those of most wind-pollinated Poales.

Wind is known to be a facilitator of self-pollination (Culley, Weller & Sakai, 2002), which would lead to a decrease in HE. Anemophily is also related to low levels of genetic structure, due to high pollen mobility (Ennos, 1994; Hamrick & Godt, 1996a). However, the low airflow currents in the tropical forest understorey would not appear to be compatible with anemophily. Sajo et al. (2012) studied morphological and ontogenetic aspects of inflorescences of A. marantoidea and suggested that wind pollination is unlikely to occur in this species. Several studies of grasses occurring in tropical forests indicate the possibility of another mode of pollination, based on the documentation of frequent visitation of insects to the flowers of bamboos and other forest Poaceae (Soderstrom & Calderón, 1971; Sajo et al., 2008; Dórea et al., 2018). Based on the levels of diversity and population structure found, we infer that wind pollination is not likely in this species....Gene flow in plants is directly related to the vagility of pollen and seeds (Hamrick & Godt, 1996a). As already discussed, the breeding system of A. marantoidea is poorly known. Dórea et al. (2017) described the pollen grains of A. marantoidea, which have characteristics compatible with transport by biotic vectors (potentially insects). However, these authors did not perform any detailed experimental work relating to pollination of A. marantoidea, although these data indicate the potential for insect or insect-aided pollination for this species. The population structure also suggests a more restricted pollination vector, unlike what would be expected in a wind-pollinated species. Ambophily, which has been suggested to occur in some Neotropical species of Poaceae, is also a possibility (Wolowski & Freitas, 2015).""",explicit from the text (described as such),syndrome,"1 - Pollination syndrome based on interpretations of images or illustrations and text, and similar species, least confident",,,,,,,species,Ruby Stephens,9/2/2022

Data are available only for American members of the family (Kennedy 1978). Here, euglossine bees of the genera Euglossa, Eulaema, Euplusia, and Exaerete have been reported to visit representa- tives of most New World genera. Pollination by species of Euglossa and Eulaema has been studed in detail. One aberrant species of Calathea, C. timothei, is supposed, on circumstantial evidence, to be bird-pollinated (Kennedy 1977). No data exist for species of the Old World, where euglossines are absent. The structural peculiarities of the marantaceous flower are well explained by the pollination mechanism. The anther develops precociously. In bud it is pressed against the stamp of the style (stylar cavity of Kennedy 1978). When still in bud, it opens and the sticky pollen is attached to the stamp. The developing style is included in the cucullate staminode, by which it is held backwards-curved under tension due to differen- tial lengthening. At this point the flower opens. When a pollinator forces its head down between the callose and cucullate staminodes, guided by the callosities of the former, it touches the appendage of the cucullate staminode, pressing it to the side. This releases the style, which snaps for- ward and downward. The course is such that the apex of the style enters the proboscidial fossa of the visitor, scraping existing pollen into the funnel-shaped stigmatic cavity. Immediately afterwards, new pollen is deposited from the stamp. Deposition is aided by the sticky substance formed by the glandlike tissue distally lining the stamp...Maranta L...Corolla tube 1/2 to twice the length of the lobes; outer staminodes 2, petaloid; cucullate staminode with a small, flat appendage near base oflobe; ",interpreted from the text,syndrome,"3 - Pollination syndrome but adaptations for animal pollination (nectar, scent, staminodes, sticky pollen) or else wind pollination (very reduced perianth, feathery stigma, exposed anthers with dry powdery pollen) or abiotic pollination clearly described",,,,,,,species,Ruby Stephens,4/2/2022

The species is native to western North America, where it is mainly insect-pollinated (Cook 1962). Cook (1962) also stated that E. californica presents anemophily; however, the importance of this type of pollina- tion has not been evaluated. In populations of E. californica from central Chile it was determined, through a pollinator exclusion experiment, that seed production depends on polli- nator activity (Arredondo-Nun~ez 2011). Furthermore, it was found that individuals of E. californica in populations from Chile and California (USA) are mostly self-incompatible (Cook 1962; Leger & Rice 2007), and that those having a degree of self-compatibility produce more seeds with cross-pollination than with self-pollination (Cook 1962; Arredondo-Nun~ez 2011)...On each selected individual, one flower was assigned to a pollinator exclusion treatment and covered with a semi-transparent bag of tulle netting...A total of 14 species of insect pollinator belonging to four orders and seven families were identified as having visited E. californica flowers. The most represented families were Apidae (four species) and Halictidae (four species)...Fruit set (number of fruits/number of flowers) in the pollinator exclusion treatment was 30.8%, while in the control group it was 92.3% (n = 52 flowers)...Our pollinator exclusion experiment in an E. californica population showed that seed production requires pollinator visitation. However, this exclusion experiment, as well as others (e.g. Mun~oz & Cavieres 2008; Vale etal. 2011), does not exclude the possible effect of wind pollination on fruit and seed production (e.g. Goodwillie 1999). Cook (1962) states that anemophily in E. californica could be facilitated by the large amount of pollen produced by the flowers and size of the pollen grains (29–55 9 29–36 lm), which is similar to that of other wind-pollinated species (Heusser 1971).""",explicit from the text (described as such),system,"6 - Pollination system, wind pollination explicitly tested for, pollination rewards clear, pollination efficiency of different pollinators tested",pollen,no,,"""Eschscholzia californica (Papaveraceae) is an invasive perennial herb in Chile (Quiroz et al. 2009).

In addition, previously emasculated flowers (n = 200) were bagged with 1 mm2 plastic mesh to prevent the entry of insects and then monitored for fruit set. Some of these bagged flowers (n = 20) were removed after 24 h to determine the number of pollen grains deposited on the stigma as a result of wind...Our results suggest that the pollination syndrome of T. sinense is ambophily (pollination by both wind and
insects). In pollination experiments, emasculated flowers bagged with plastic mesh set fruits, indicating T. sinense is wind-pollinated. Because inflorescences covered by paper bags did not set fruit, but did when hand-pollinated, the tree does not set fruits by apomixis. A lot of airborne pollen caught on the glass microslides also supports the effectiveness of wind pollination. The anemophilous floral features of T. sinense include the absence of petals, the papillate stigma, exposed anthers and stigma and elon- gated catkin-like inflorescences (Vikas 2011; Yamasaki & Sakai 2013).

It could be argued, however, that the staminodes in Canacomyrica function as attractants for generalist pollinators. Although Myricaceae are generally considered to be an anemophilous family, in Hawai’i it has been observed that introduced honey bees (Apis mellifera) visit the flowers of Morella faya (Aiton) Wilbur (Vitousek & Walker, 1989). Elsewhere, among the predominantly wind-pollinated Fagales, staminodes have been recorded in Lithocarpus Blume, Triganobalanus Forman, Quercus subg. Cyclobalanopsis (Oersted) C. K. Schneider and all Castanoideae (Fagaceae; Kaul, 1985; Kubitzki, 1993a). In Lithocarpus, the presence of staminodes is acknowl- edged to be associated with entomophily (Kaul, 1985) and in Juglandaceae, insect pollination has been observed in Platycarya (Endress, 1986). This raises the possibility that Canacomyrica may be insect pollinated and thus indicates an entomophilous ancestry for Myricaceae. Such a suggestion is consistent with the notion that wind-pollination in Fagales may have multi- ple origins from insect-pollinated ancestral lineages (Manos & al., 2001).""",interpreted from the text,syndrome,"1 - Pollination syndrome based on interpretations of images or illustrations and text, and similar species, least confident",,,,,,"Extremely ambiguous discussion, my interpretation is that it is likely primarily wind pollinated (also from looking at illustration of flowers in Kubitzki volume 2) but others may disagree I guess and hasn't been explicitly tested",species,Ruby Stephens,10/3/2022

Although this species exhibits homostylous, self-compatible flowers in the study area, pollinator visitation can duplicate the number of ripe fruits (and seeds per fruit) produced by plants (Cuautle & Rico-Gray, 2003). Each plant produces between 3 and 16 (with a mean of 5.54), yellow flowers ⁄ day which last on average 4 h. Anthesis occurs 2–3 h after dawn. Flowers of T. ulmifolia have five nectar pockets, which alternate with the corolla lobes. Because the flowers last only few hours, the process of nectar secretion, pollen release and stigmatic receptivity is closely synchronized (Elias et al., 1975), suggesting that nectar reabsorption and response to nectar removal by pollinators may be negligible. Flower visitors at the study site include butterflies (Lycaenidae, Pieridae and Hesperidae); bees (Apidae, Halictidae and Megachilidae); flies (Bombilidae); and occasional nectar-seeking ants and wasps (Nubia Lara Rodrı ́guez, pers. com.). Bees and skippers are more likely to function as true pollinators because their sizes allow them to touch fertile parts of the flower, whereas Lycaenidae and Pieridae butterflies are probably nectar thieves (S.

Wind in the tropical lowland rain forest is too limited to have much influence. Anyway, the notion is refuted by the shortening of the axis of the pistillate inflorescences: wind pollination requires good exposure. Possibly only some species of higher elevation might be abiotically pollinated. Bawa & Opler (1975) have hypothesized that a correlation exists for dioecious spe- cies in tropical forests to have relatively small flowers of white to yellow or pale green colour. Such flowers are thought to attract, because of their unspecialized morphologies, a wide variety of relatively small insects, primarily small bees (see also Bawa, 1994). The dioecious short, small flowers of Aporosa, which bear no special features, certainly seem to point to this type of pollinators. Webster (1994a) gives as probable pollinator for the unspecialized Euphorbiaceae “small, general wasps and flies” and S. Thomas told me he had seen only Trigonid bees (Trigona) on Aporosa at Pasoh Forest, which is in contrast to, e.g., Diospyros, which was visited by a host of different insects.""",interpreted from the text,syndrome,"2 - Pollination syndrome based on interpretations of images or illustrations and text, and similar species, still relatively confident",,,,,,"Also by reference to illustration of Aporosa frutescens pistillate flowers, which are quite stout and round so not shaped for intercepting pollen in the wind",species,Ruby Stephens,17/3/2022

Experimental data indicate that both visual and olfactory cues are important in attracting flies to flowers. Flies (mostly female L. papuensis) obtain loads of the viscous liquid pollen matrix by visiting male flowers and entering anther grooves on the central column of the flower, precisely guided by ridges armed with hairs that force the fly into a position in which the pollen is positioned on the dorsal part of the thorax. ""Windows"" on the inside of the perigone diaphragm apparently help orient their flight inside flowers. Pollen-loaded flies visiting female flowers may enter the infradiscoidal sulcus formed by a broad ring of stigmatic tissue above and the expanded base of the column below. On entering the sulcus the fly is wedged in so tightly that pollen is rubbed off the thorax onto the stigma. Only large flies could be effective in picking up pollen from male flowers and transferring it to female flowers.

The flowers lack nectar and are therefore supposed to be pollinated mainly by pollen- collecting insects such as various bee and syrphid species (MuÈ ller, 1883), or insects in general (Clapham et al., 1987). In the absence of insects, self-pollination may take place (MuÈ ller, 1883; Clapham et al., 1987)...Filipendula pollen is very small (<20 lm), about half the size of both Calluna and Plantago pollen (Moore et al., 1991). The flowers of F. vulgaris are of the dish- shaped type sensu Faegri & Van der Pijl (1971) with copious amounts of pollen and well-exposed anthers, which is a prerequisite for wind pollination. Furthermore, the species occurs on open and very wind-exposed sites, where wind pollination is effective.""
Further evidence for adaptation to a wind pollination strategy comes from the study of Dobson et al. (1996) investigating the flower and pollen odours of F. vulgaris. Dobson et al. found that the pollen odour of this species is dominated by 2-heptadecanone (63%), a substance that is suspected to deter or even to be toxic to insects. Dobson et al. (1996) hypothesized that F. vulgaris is evolving away from reliance on insects for pollination.
Our investigation of regional and local levels of genetic variation as well as the supplementary investigation of wind dispersal of pollen in F. vulgaris point in the same direction. In spite of the fact that most floras and textbooks mention F. vulgaris as being exclusively pollinated by insects, our study suggests that pollen transport takes place by wind with subsequent pollination.",explicit from the text (described as such),system,"6 - Pollination system, wind pollination explicitly tested for, pollination rewards clear, pollination efficiency of different pollinators tested",pollen,no,,"""The flowers lack nectar and are therefore supposed to be pollinated mainly by pollen- collecting insects such as various bee and syrphid species (MuÈ ller, 1883), or insects in general""",explicit from the text (described as such),also in TRY as insect pollinated,species,Ruby Stephens,31/1/2022

Moreover, the pendulous, cryptic, and catkin-like inflorescences are ideally suited for anemophily. The structures are blown by the wind and clouds of yellow pollen are visibly dispersed. Once caught by the air currents, the pollen is easily transferred to the receptive stigmas of the female inflorescences, which are pendulous at the ends of the shoots and are readily exposed to the pollen bearing wind. The male floral morphology is also well-adapted for wind pollination. Since the stamens are opposite the four slits or windows of the partially connate perianth, the anthers are directly exposed. When air passes through the flowers, the pollen is blown out of the slit and into the air stream. In addition, the passage of the wind over the subtending and partially enveloping bract causes suction which forcibly removes the pollen from the perianth chamber. Formed from the terminally fused perianth segments (Plate 8B), the perianth chamber is of considerable significance. Anther dehiscence is introrse by means of longitudinal slits so that during anthesis the pollen is unable to fall to the ground.

The staminodes secrete a thick, slimy, yellow substance, and the entire flower emits a foul odor. The stamens are tightly enclosed by the base of the perianth. The petals and staminodes close at the end of the first day. On the second day the numerous petals and dehisced stamens reflex to such an extent as to function as a landing platform for insects visiting the pendulous flowers. The staminodes, however, remain closed about the single large carpel. After a few hours the flower shatters leaving only the carpel.
The slimy staminode secretions may function as food for insects or sticky material to provide greater pollen adherence to the insect's bodies. Since the flowers are pendulous and the stamens extrorse (figs. 4 and 6), one would expect the lower body surfaces of the visiting insects to carry large quantities of pollen. The above observations were made on cut flowers, as the movements could not be observed on the large tree, and are consistent with observations on a greenhouse-grown plant (Huckins 1976).
One species of beetle (table 3), a nitidulid, Haptoncus takhtajani, was captured from two flowers. All captured beetles carried pollen of Degeneria. This is the same beetle species collected from Degeneria vitiensis in 1971 by A. Takhtajan (A. Cronquist, pers. comm.,2 Medvedev and Ter-Minasyan 1973), probably from the same plant. The tree is in a pasture near the margin of a forest on a steep slope. This plant is unusual in that it produces flowers although it is only 15-20m tall. A 3m plant of Degeneria bloomed in the Climatron at St. Louis, Mo.; however, in nature the plants are at least 30-35 m in height before flowering is initiated.

Flower visitors were mainly hover flies and bees...Wind pollination occurs in seven of the studied Piperaceae: Piper arboreum, P. gaudichaudianum, P. macedoi, P. mikanianum, P. xylosteoides, Ottonia martiana and O. propinqua (Table 2). Anemophily has previously been recorded only for P. nigrum in Panama (Martin and Gregory, 1962), whereas other Central American Piper species are not wind pollinated (Semple, 1974; Fleming, 1985). As the bags used for insect exclusion may have affected access by windblown pollen, the estimation of wind pollination (Table 2) may be conservative. Furthermore, small insects initially present in the bag may have also contributed to fruit set by autogamy or geitonogamy, as perhaps occurred in P. crassinervium. Four species, P. aduncum, P. mollicomum, P. regnelli and Pothomorphe umbellata, did not yield substantially more fruits in insect-proof bags than could have been accounted for by within-inflorescence fertilization in waterproof bags, hence they were not considered to be wind pollinated. The majority of species grow at the edge of the forest, an appropriate place for pollen transport by wind (Arruda and Sazima, 1988), but Piper arboreum, P. gaudichaudianum, P. mikanianum, P. regnelli, O. martiana and O. propinqua also grow in the forest under-storey. These individuals, too, are effectively pollinated by wind (Table 2). Bawa and Crisp (1980) and Bawa et al. (1985) also recorded some anemophilous under-storey species within the Moraceae. Species of Piperaceae exhibit some classic traits of anemophilous plants, such as the increase of individuals flowering in windy months ( from September to December, see Fig. 1), the small and pulverulent pollen grains and the protogynous flowers (Lloyd and Webb, 1986; Honig et al., 1992). Piper amalago, P. crassinervium and P. glabratum may be exclusively insect-pollinated. As insects visit inflorescences of all Piperaceae species (Table 2), these plants may well benefit from insect pollination, although we have no evidence of this since none of our treatments excluded wind pollination. Flies (mainly hoverflies, Syrphidae: Diptera) and bees (mainly Apidae: Hymenoptera) were the most frequent visitors, transporting Piperaceae pollen on their bodies (Fig. 2B). Central American Piper species are pollinated mainly by stingless bees of the genus Trigona (Apidae: Hymenoptera) (Semple, 1974; Fleming, 1985).""

Geometrid moths and beetles visit some dipterocarp flowers at night, but have not been demonstrated to effect pollination.

Despite the presence of small pollen grains, normally associated with wind pollination, the Crotonoid-pattern of exine, the large amount of pollenkitt and the presence of nectar are typical entomophilous adaptations. Among insects visiting the plant, thrips (Thysanoptera) might have a role in pollination owing to their large number and for the constant presence of T. hirsuta pollen on their body. In contrast, no evidence of anemophilous transport of pollen was obtained, clashing with reports of a wind pollination system for Egyptian populations. Based on our observations wind seems not to play a key role in the pollination process of this species in the Northern Mediterranean region, while insects might play a major role...This strongly suggests that in this marginal area of the species range insects could be involved in pollen transport, while the role of wind would be less important, as shown by the absence of pollen grains in the air surrounding the plants. Nonetheless, reports of a wind pollination system for this species are referred to Egypt and other areas of the Southern Mediterranean basin (Ramadan et al. 1994; El- Keblawy et al. 1995, 1996; Freeman et al. 1997; El-Keblawy and Freeman 1999).

Various insects (e.g. dragonflies) perch on the spadices but may be using them simply as landing sites (P. B. Tomlinson, pers. comm.). I have not detected any odor from a single spadix, but numerous flowering spadices placed in a jar produce a perceptible foul, fungal odor (J.C. French, pers. comm.), which may serve as an attractant for flies or beetles (Grayum, 1990). It would be interesting to determine whether the spadix generates heat during flowering, as it does in some other Araceae, such as Symplocarpus (Grayum, 1990).
The pollen grains of Orontium lack starch and are relatively large (mean of longest diameter: 64/-Lm). In the Araceae, starchless pollen is associated with pollination by bees or flies (Grayum, 1985) while large pollen is correlated with pollination by bees or beetles (Grayum, 1986). The type of pollen sculpturing in Orontium (foveolate-reticulate- Grayum, 1985) is considered to be unspecialized for particular pollinators but is associated with pollination by bees, flies, and beetles in this family (Grayum, 1986).""",interpreted from the text,syndrome,"2 - Pollination syndrome based on interpretations of images or illustrations and text, and similar species, still relatively confident",,,,,,,species,Ruby Stephens,11/1/2022

Although only self-pollination has been observed in the family, the occurrence of protandry, the flower structure and the presence of nectar-producing structures in various groups would point to cross-pollination. Indeed, Vogel (1962) supposed that several species of Thismia are pollinated by small Diptera attracted by scent and falling into the urceolate flowers. Vogel (1978) also suggested that Thismia fungiformis may be pollinated by fungus gnats tricked into laying eggs in the fungus-mimicking flower. Rubsamen (1986) twice found an egg or larva inside the nectaries of a Gymnosiphon flower, possibly of a visiting insect.
Self-pollination appears to be the rule in numer- ous members of the family and is facilitated by the close proximity of anthers and stigma. Premature dehiscence of the anthers in bud, germination of the pollen inside the thecae, and pollen tubes reaching from the anthers to the stigma and even penetrating the stigma, have been recorded for species of most genera.
According to Miers (1866), the flowers of Thismia hyalina are cleistogamous. Burmannia coelestis and Thismia javanica are reported by Ernst and Bernard (1910) to be apogamous.""",guessed from the illustration,syndrome,"1 - Pollination syndrome based on interpretations of images or illustrations and text, and similar species, least confident",,,,,,Photos of species on iNaturalist appear insect pollinated (https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/581594-Burmannia-madagascariensis/browse_photos) but notes from Kubitzki and other studies in family suggest self-pollination is prevalent,species,Ruby Stephens,18/1/2022

The copious pollen produced by the pendulous, paniculate staminate inflorescences (Fig. 16b) is devoid of a pollenkitt and blows easily in the wind...To test for wind pollination, flow patterns around pistillate inflorescences were examined with a laboratory wind tunnel using the techniques of Niklas (1982), and in the field using a portable smoke-injection apparatus (Cox, 1985)...piral patterns in the xy and xz planes indicated that pistillate Pandanus tectorius inflorescences function as highly efficient pollen receivers, being hydrodynamically analogous to some filter-feeding marine invertebrates.

The flower does not seem to represent a type specialized for insect pollination; most insects could easily drink the nectar without ever touching either the anthers or the small stigma. In fact, only a single small bumblebee was seen to visit flowers. The inflorescences are strikingly devoid of insect life, even in the brief sunny periods. Yet the flower does not represent the tubular shape and red coloration which is normally associated with bird-pollinated flowers, such as Fuchsia, Bomarea, Centropogon, Ericaceae, and others in the Costa Rican mountains. There is no doubt in my mind, however, that birds are the main pollinators. A very elusive, grey bird is often present among Gaiadendron racemes aiid seems to visit the flowers. Unfortunately, I was unable to identify the bird, or get a clear view of it as it clambered among the branches. The main visitor in the Talamanca area, however, appears to be a dark, green-metallic hummingbird which is probably Eugenesfulgens (4). It usually rested on a dead branch for a short while a t arrival, then made the rounds of the inflorescences (Fig. 12), hovering briefly before each flower, then whirring away again. The small, grey bird mentioned above at times took exception to the hummingbird's presence and chased it away from the Gaiadendron tree. The importance of bird pollination in this area may be underlined by pointing out the restriction of insect activity by rains and lower temperatures, which are much less restrictive to the activities of warm-blooded animals. In fact, the hummingbird mentioned visited Gaiadendron flowers even during moderately heavy showers.""",explicit from the text (described as such),system,"5 - Pollination system but wind pollination not explicitly tested for, pollination rewards clear, pollination efficiency of different pollinators not explicitly tested but pollinators observed transporting pollen and effecting pollination",,,,,,Images at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/496333-Gaiadendron-punctatum/browse_photos?term_id=12&term_value_id=13,species,Ruby Stephens,24/3/2022

Summaries of known visitors to flowers (Hawkeswood, 1981; Brown et al., 1997) support Drummond’s (1843) early surmise that Nuytsia flowers were a ‘favourite haunt of insects and insect-eating honey-sucking birds’. Hawkeswood (1981) proposed that beetles and wasps appear to be the most common and efficient visitors, excluding introduced European honey bees, instead of earlier suggestions, e.g. by Sargent (1918), that birds were the main pollinators. Nevertheless there is a strong association of birds with flowering plants, perhaps representing a combination of nectar feeding and hawking for the insects attracted to the nectar. ‘The flowers . . . attract birds such as the red wattlebird, little wattlebird, brown honeyeater, western spinebill, New Holland honeyeater and silvereye. The yellow-rumped thornbill, black-faced cuckoo-shrike and bee- eater eat insects attracted to the flowers. Up to six [Rainbow] bee-eaters have been seen congregating at a single tree.
