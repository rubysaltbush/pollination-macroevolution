pollination_macroevolution_datatopublish_20221125 - Ruby Stephens - added 2022-10-14 - updated 2022-11-25 - pollination system or syndrome data for 1201 species from Ramírez-Barahona et al (2020) tree, with full references for sources of data and notes on pollination rewards, re-checked 2022-11-25 to ensure "animal" pollination syndromes can't be made more specific

eFLOWER-1209_RC_complete_MCC.phy - Hervé Sauquet - added 2021-10-20 - "The tree I am sending was obtained by converting tip names into those matching explicit species and dropping the 8 extra tips. For reference, this is the MCC tree from the RC-complete analysis of Santiago's paper. This is an electronic tree file in Phylip (basic parenthetic) format."

ATT2_superbiomes_v1.2_NoCold.csv - Hervé Sauquet - added 2022-05-09 - superbiomes from Ramírez-Barahona et al (2020), for 1201 taxa in the pollination1209 data set. Sent by email on 29 April 2022

SA_thin_trees_corrected.tre - Santiago Ramírez-Barahona and Andrea López Martinez - added 2022-05-31 - multiPhylo tree from RB2020 posterior trees incorporating uncertainty in phylogeny of RB2020, with names matched to names in eFLOWER1209 data using code provided by Andrea. Trees are SA thin trees=CC_complete_trees TOO BIG FOR GITHUB ADDED TO .gitignore updated with updated species names as tip labels 2022-06-30

filtered_obs_ruby.csv - Will Cornwell - added 2022-07-01 - GBIF records from https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/download/0357632-210914110416597 download "filtered down to records more recent than 1980 and also your species list.  Then it was run through most of the filters covered in this paper:
Zizka, Alexander, et al. "CoordinateCleaner: Standardized cleaning of occurrence records from biological collection databases." Methods in Ecology and Evolution 10.5 (2019): 744-751.
plus a few I invented myself: I didn't do the sea/land/country identity filter as that would lose the sea grasses in your dataset (but catch a few more errors)...At the end of the day, it looks like we only lack spatial information for 37 out of the 1201 species.  And at least some of these are taxonomic issues (e.g. Hibbertia volubilis).  But there are also some legit data gaps in GBIF (e.g. https://www.gbif.org/species/5300941 and https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?taxon_key=4161359)
One thing to note is that GBIF reports two names for every record--the column called "species" and a column called "verbatimscientificname". I've tried to match both to your species list to save some of the data from abyss of taxonomic confusion.  "species" is what GBIF thinks the current name is, and "verbatimscientificname" is what the data provider gave them--some of your species list only is found in one or the other columns.  But this will mean you'll have to wraggle those two columns at a later stage in the workflow." TOO BIG FOR GITHUB ADDED TO .gitignore

globalmeanLAI1981_2020.tif - GLOBMAP https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4700264 - added 2022-10-14 - updated 2022-11-10 - raster of global Leaf Area Index values averaged from GLOBMAP data from 1981-2020 (Liu, Y., R. Liu, and J. M. Chen (2012), Retrospective retrieval of long-term consistent global leaf area index (1981–2011) from combined AVHRR and MODIS data, J. Geophys.
